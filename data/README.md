Place a Maxmind (or other GeoIP-compatible database) here for country-level lookups.

This has been tested with the MaxMind `GeoIP2 Binary` format, which may be provides as a zipped `.mmdb` file.

Rename the `.mmdb` file to be `countries.dat`, and place it in this directory. `data/countries.dat` is in this project's `.gitignore`.

See [kuno/GeoIP](https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP) for more information.
