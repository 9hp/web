isitchristmas.com Warrant Canary

Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide
for secret warrants, searches and seizures of data, such as library records.

Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for revealing the warrant, search or seizure, disallowing the disclosure of events that would materially affect the users of a service
such as isitchristmas.com.

isitchristmas.com and its principals and employees will in fact comply with such warrants and their provisions for secrecy.

isitchristmas.com will also make available, weekly, a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:

- a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place

- a cut and paste answer from a major answer source, establishing date

Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page.

Notes:

This scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce isitchristmas.com to produce false declarations.  The answer in the signed message serves to demonstrate that that update could not possibly have been created prior to that date.  It shows that a series of these updates were not created in advance and posted on this page.
